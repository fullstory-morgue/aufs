Note:
- the described date are all in JST.
- CVS handles UTC as its timezone.
- all these descriptions should be archived in the ML on sourceforge,
  since I always post there and let users know. But sometimes archiving
  failed. this is the main reason to begin writing this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

20070320
- bugfix: brokn df(1)/statfs(2), wrong argument for vfs_statfs().

20070319
- bugfix: check the maximum number of branches, reported by Tomas M.
- testing the inode number after the direct rename of a dir.
- testing new mount option 'dlgt.'
- testing lockdep.
- add a new file vfsub.c
- support O_LARGEFILE at copying-up a regular file, and opening a dir.
- change some function signature and a global variable name in order
  to avoid the symbol conflict, one of them was reported by Just Marc.

20070312
- gave up handling inode S_PRIVATE flag and supporting LSM generally.
- minor optimization by LOOKUP_DIRECTORY flag.
- testing NFS-exporting.
- still testing lockdep.
- still testing sysfs.
- add samples for LiveCD over NFS.
- add a note suggested by Simon Sasburg.

20070305
- support copyup a 'tail-hole'ed sparse file.
- still testing lockdep.
- still testing sysfs.

20070226
- bugfix: mis-judging the maximum number of branches.
- bugfix: branch index at '--add --before path', reported and fixed by
  Fernando A. P. Gomes.
- refine inotify, a test finished.
- still testing LSM.
- begin testing with lockdep, still testing.
- begin supporting sysfs, still testing.
- refine the maximum number of branches.
- add a caution about AUFS_HINOTIFY and AUFS_DEBUG_RWSEM.
- refine copyup pseudo-link, remove cpup_pseudo_link() function.
- refine copyup pseudo-link, call test_and_cpup_dirs() and
  sio_cpup_simple() instead of cpup_pseudo_link().
- refine copyup pseudo-link, a new function lkup_plink().
- refine new_inode(), call iget_locked() instead of iget() and test
  I_NEW.
- minor optimization, the macro mnt_nfs().
- remove d_iput() operation.
- introduce a new member 'si_mnt' and 'si_sb.'
- change some options for tail(1) and grep(1) in order to support
  busybox, suggested by Tomas M.
- introduce two new files, module.h and vfsub.h.

20070219
- mmap behaviour changed, by removing mmap counter.
- bugfix: after a branch was changed from RO to RW, the hidden opened file
  should be closed once.
- bugfix: when the given mount options are too long, aufs should return an
  error expectedly, reported by Tomas M.
- support directory link count.
- introduce ./Kconfig.in and make target 'kconfig', which will
  generate ./fs/aufs/Kconfig.
- introduce configurable amount of branches. but I am afraid you will
  have to wait for aufs supports sysfs.
- still testing LSM.
- refine hidden inotify, still testing. disable udba=inotify temporary while
  parsing mount options.
- call vfs_read/write() instead of hidden file operation, in order to support
  LSM and notify.
- extract some functions from super.c, and create a new file module.c.

20070212
- begin supporting a readonly no-whiteout aufs branch of another aufs, still
  testing.
- begin supporting exporting aufs via NFS, still testing.
- begin supporting LSM, still testing.
- bugfix unionctl: typo or dropped single quotation.
- bugfix unionctl: support a relative path for --whereis.
- unionctl aborts when the --whereis argument does not exist.

20070205
- bugfix: a test in adding a branch, included in a report from
  Laville Guillaume.
  check the adding branch to be overlapped or not, even if it is a
  mount-point.
- bugfix: unionctl script --whereis option.
  the action should print the branch path, instead of the given argument, even
  it has only one argument.
- begin supporting inode S_PRIVATE flag and CONFIG_SECURITY. still testing.
- remove all the nested function definition, since some compilers (or their
  configuration) issue a warning about that.

20070129
- introduce diropq option.
  the behaviour of mkdir(2) and rename(2) dir case is changed. now they don't
  make '.wh..wh..opq' when it is not necessary. this is the default. if
  you dislike this behaviour and still want to make it always, use
  'diropq=always' mount option. see the manual in detail.
- bugfix: make fsync(2) return success when the file is not opened for writing,
  reported by Martin Walter.
  I am afraid this behaviour may violate some standards. Checking the
  behaviour of ext2, aufs decided to return success.
- rename some functions
	+ lookup_whtmp() to lkup_whtmp().
	+ lock_hdir_lookup_wh() to lock_hdir_lkup_wh().
	+ lookup_wh() to lkup_wh().
- I forgot update AUFS_VERSION on last Monday and I updated it on
  Thursday. Sorry for confusion.

20070117
- bugfix i_op.c: uninitialized variable in case of CONFIG_AUFS_FAKE_DM
  enabled, reported and fixed by Jason Lunz.

20070115
- support 'security' model, reported and tested by Ulrich Holeschak.
  you need to disable CONFIG_AUFS_FAKE_DM.
- introduce umount.aufs script.
- umount.aufs and mount.aufs scripts calls auplink script when it is needed
  and configured.
- auplink script supports /etc/default/auplink configuration.
- bugfix: a comment in local.mk, reported and fixed by Wilhelm Meier.

20070112
- Jason Lunz sent a patch which creates linux/fs/aufs/Kconfig.

20070108
- disable CONFIG_AUFS_COMPAT by default.
  If you still want to use it, enable it manually. But this configuration will
  be removed in a few weeks.
- a new script named auplink, with an executable aulchown and a mount option
  'clean_plink', are introduced, in order to reproduce all hardlinks on a
  writable branch.
- bugfix: full-fix for pseudo-link which was temporary half-fix in last update.
- bugfix: link instead of copyup for an already pseudo-linked file.
- bugfix: hide the unnecessary 'remount' option before comm(1) in mount.aufs script.

20061222
- I found a bug about pseudo-link. It keeps inodes incorrectly, and users may
  see the deleted inode. The fix will complete next year. Until then,
  pseudo-link feature and 'plink' mount option are disabled and 'noplink' is
  the default mount option. It means the the internal behaviour like
  copy-up will be changed.
- begin supporting linux-2.6.20.
- support 'sillyrename' on NFS branch
- added a sample for diskless machines which uses aufs as root filesystem.
- CONFIG_AUFS_COMPAT will be removed in a few weeks. The code in case of
  CONFIG_AUFS_COMPAT=y remains. In detail,
	+ default branch permission
	+ warning about wrong mount option
	+ /proc/mounts shows 'br:' instead of 'dirs='
	+ .wh.__dir_opaque is replaced by .wh..wh..opq
- bugfix: on NFS branch, after rename(2) to an existed file, the new named
  file may refer to the old inode. this fix is not completed and does not
  support plink option. This is the reason of disabling pseudo-link temporary.
- bugfix: a pipeline in unionctl script uses 'return', but it just
  finishes the pipeline and doesn't exit from the function.

20061218
- discussing with Tomas M, introduced a new action --whereis to unionctl.
- remove the kernel version from the aufs version string.
  some people misunderstands that the kernel version in the aufs version
  string means the supported kernel version. Actually, it is the tested kernel
  version, as it is described in README.
- new mount option, warn_perm and nowarn_perm.
- support the space characters in the paths of mount point and branches.
- support statfs(2) when the first branch is NFS.

20061211
- support linux-2.6.19, including NFS branch. you need lhash.patch.
- in the manual, describe that the white characters, comma, colon in the path
  are not allowed. suggested by Tomas M.
- unionctl script, support CONFIG_AUFS_COMPAT. reported and fixed by Tomas M.
- prepend double wh prefix to tmpname at renaming dir.

20061204
- mis-detecting CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP.
- support the cases without /sbin/mount.aufs
	+ remove si_dupopt.
	+ compare the xino filename.

20061127
- bugfix dir->fsync: it may be called with @file being NULL, especially from
  nfsv4, reported by Klaus Knopper.
- unionctl script supports --list option, requested by Tomas M.

20061120
- pseudo-link: update hidden inode pointers by new function d_iput().
- pseudo-link: stop pseudo-link when the target inode already exists.
- cpup: restore the inode pointers after cpup whiteout failure.
- hinotify: restore the counter after rename_whtmp() failure.

20061113
- bugfix: before 2.6.17, msync(2) calls ->fsync without
  lock. CONFIG_AUFS_DEBUG failed checking the lock, reported by Wesley Chow.
- bugfix: link(2), when the link target inode already exists on the target
  branch, but the target name, aufs_link() failed copyup.
- bugfix: re-setting xino after setting noxino, aufs failed setting.
- force noxino when xino_init() returns an error
- warn only once per 255 times about "too many pseudo links".

20061106
- support linux-2.6.15, limited. dropped features are,,,
	+ plink and noplink mount option
	+ udba=inotify mount option
	+ NFS branch

20061023
- 'anonymous nobody' kindly sent a patch to SF 'Patches' place. The patch
  is for merging aufs into kernel source tree.
- begin supporting linux-2.6.19-rc2, unfinished, untested and NFS branch
  is not supported.
- gave up supporting read/write to the mmapped file on NFS branch. it
  seems a bug in linux and it can happen on any filesystem. it will be
  fixed in linux-2.6.19 or later.
- new structure aufs_hdentry for hidden dentry.
- bugfix: at restoring the timestamps of the parent dir when mkdir(2) failed.

  linux-2.6.18 kernel, call it from put_super() too.

20061009
- bugfix: call igrab() before ii_write_unlock() to prevent from destroying

- refined memory allocation which size is zero.

20060911
- There might be a bug around kfree() in aufs. CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB has
  reported slab corruption once. It is not reproducible but I am still
  working on.
- the fstype name is always "aufs" as I have announced.
- minor optimization by GCC's branch prediction or linux's unlikely macro.
